     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"Built for the biggest races. \r\n\r\nWhen our racers travel to big mountains like the Chilean Andes for the Andes-Pacifico, they bring their Nomads. One look at the terrain tells you why – it’s rough, steep and more worthy of being a World Cup DH course than an enduro stage. Under these circumstances, the Nomad’s aggressive 65-degree head angle delivers V10 handling at Syndicate speeds. 165mm of VPP™ travel is delivered via a V10-style upper link and neatly recessed lower link design that's been extended to the Bronson and 5010.\r\n\r\nThe Nomad is uncompromising in its purpose, and as such has been designed specifically around one-by drivetrains only.  One-by offers a wide range of  options for just about any kind of riding, and the design permits some seriously compact chainstays.  On the front end of the bike, the rangy cockpit and relatively steep seat tube angle make for a surprisingly efficient pedaling position for such a capable descender. Internal cable routing comes courtesy of thin carbon fiber tubes molded into the frame from entry to exit, ensuring completely integrated, hassle-free routing every time.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves off more than half a pound from the frame.  \r\n\r\nSRAM’s more cost-effective one-by group, DT Swiss hubs, Reverb Stealth post\r\nRockshox Pike RCT3 160 Fork\r\nSRAM X01 Derailleur\r\nSRAM Guide RSC Brakes\r\nRaceface Turbine, 32t Cranks"[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"Cross country racing has its own list of demands, and speed is at the top of the list. Our Epic Comp Carbon World Cup answers the call with a tighter geometry, along with shorter chainstays and tube lengths in comparison to a \"standard\" Epic. This gives the World Cup more explosive power transfer and nimbler handling, especially when paired up with the carbon chassis and M5 alloy rear end. As for the build, you truly start to see the theme of uncompromising speed at work, as we've hung some of SRAM's most reliable parts on this bike. And to make sure that you'll be utilizing every watt of power out of them, we included our Mini Brain rear shock that differentiates rider input from trail bumps to ensure that the bike stays stiff when you need it to. With all of this going on, it's easy to see why the Epic has long been the dominant force on the cross country scene"[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"When the time came to examine whether to give the V10 27.5-inch wheels, we turned to the Syndicate, who rode the prototypes, gave us feedback, and ultimately raced the bike on the World Cup circuit. By the time the season was over, the new bike had garnered the 2014 World Cup title, and a World Champs medal. Those accolades speak for themselves, but we were eager to improve.\r\n\r\nDrawing on feedback from Peat, Minnaar and Bryceland on their personal settings, the 6th generation of our flagship model now offers 216mm / 8.5” of travel in two adjustable geometry positions:\r\nHigh: 64° headtube angle / 360mm bottom bracket height.\r\nLow: 63.5° headtube angle / 353mm bottom bracket height.\r\n\r\nThe shock rate has been tuned to be more linear and deliver  consistent damping throughout the travel. Carbon lay-up analysis and frame shape optimization allowed for more efficient use of material, and the savings were then reinvested into other areas to ensure the bike withstands Ratboy’s huge flat landings.  The front triangle and swingarm sport larger-diameter sections, but we’ll refrain from the usual drone about the positive effect that has on strength and stiffness. The new frame benefits from a slightly longer reach to suit evolving rider preferences.  However, our athletes felt we always struck a good balance with our chainstay length, so we focused on maintaining this dimension when accommodating larger wheels.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves nearly a pound from the frame.  \r\n\r\n7-Speed DH kit, Fox fork and shock\r\nFox 40 Float RC2 27.5 Factory Flat Crown Fork\r\nSRAM X01 DH 7-Speed Derailleur\r\nSRAM Guide RSC Brakes\r\nRaceface SIXC Cranks"[0m,

In desert-dry conditions the wider tires float above the dust and find oases of grip where standard tires flounder. And when the monsoon comes, lower tire pressures pull the Tallboy through the slickest of root sections like a Defender on diff-lock.\r\n\r\nIn its 29-inch form, the Tallboy’s renowned rowdy streak comes to the fore. Happy at full gas, up or down hill, the speed and agility of the 29 configuration will have you bagging on e-bikes at every turn.\r\n\r\nA 68 degree head angle and 110mm of VPP travel distills the original Tallboy’s playful character into something all the more mischievous. Longer reach and shorter chainstays fuel that personality, and bring the Tallboy bang up to date with the rest of the Santa Cruz range.\r\n\r\nA flip chip on the upper link, combined with either a 130mm fork (for 27+) or 120mm fork (for 29-inch), ensures geometry remains consistent across a vast range of build kits and sizes, from S to XXL.\r\n\r\nThe versatile trail bike of choice for rapid riders like Greg Minnaar—the Tallboy is for those who don’t roll with the pack. \r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frames, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber.

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"When we introduced Bronson, it took the market by storm, redefining what people expected from a 150mm trail bike. Equally at home in the Trans-Provence as it was on The Ridge, updating and improving it was going to be no small feat.\r\n\r\nThe most visible upgrade is the completely new VPP® link arrangement.  The lower link tucks neatly above the bottom bracket, fully-recessed and protected from impacts.  Meanwhile the box-section upper link now mounts cleanly to the top-tube and enhances lateral stiffness as a result. Shock rate’s been refined in the process too, delivering greater small bump sensitivity and a more progressive mid-stroke.\r\n\r\nGeometry has also evolved subtly to meet demand from riders for a bike of this ilk.  The seat tube angle’s been steepened, placing the rider right above the cranks and perfectly in position to lay down the power. Meanwhile a one-degree slacker 66 degree head tube angle combines with a 20-25mm longer top tube and shorter chainstay length to create an evermore rally-ready geometry than its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber.

The result is that the small and medium sizes utilize higher shock leverage ratios to ensure lighter riders make effective use of the travel.  We also used 27.5\" wheels in the small and medium sizes to improve handling and create industry-leading standover height for shorter riders.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the large and extra-large sizes come with 29\" wheels so that taller riders benefit from the rolling advantages of that wheel size.

By the time the season was over, the new bike had garnered the 2014 World Cup title, and a World Champs medal. Those accolades speak for themselves, but we were eager to improve.\r\n\r\nDrawing on feedback from Peat, Minnaar and Bryceland on their personal settings, the 6th generation of our flagship model now offers 216mm / 8.5” of travel in two adjustable geometry positions:\r\nHigh: 64° headtube angle / 360mm bottom bracket height.\r\nLow: 63.5° headtube angle / 353mm bottom bracket height.\r\n\r\nThe shock rate has been tuned to be more linear and deliver  consistent damping throughout the travel. Carbon lay-up analysis and frame shape optimization allowed for more efficient use of material, and the savings were then reinvested into other areas to ensure the bike withstands Ratboy’s huge flat landings.  The front triangle and swingarm sport larger-diameter sections, but we’ll refrain from the usual drone about the positive effect that has on strength and stiffness. The new frame benefits from a slightly longer reach to suit evolving rider preferences.  However, our athletes felt we always struck a good balance with our chainstay length, so we focused on maintaining this dimension when accommodating larger wheels.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves nearly a pound from the frame.  "[0m,

One look at the terrain tells you why – it’s rough, steep and more worthy of being a World Cup DH course than an enduro stage. Under these circumstances, the Nomad’s aggressive 65-degree head angle delivers V10 handling at Syndicate speeds. 165mm of VPP™ travel is delivered via a V10-style upper link and neatly recessed lower link design that's been extended to the Bronson and 5010.\r\n\r\nThe Nomad is uncompromising in its purpose, and as such has been designed specifically around one-by drivetrains only.  One-by offers a wide range of  options for just about any kind of riding, and the design permits some seriously compact chainstays.  On the front end of the bike, the rangy cockpit and relatively steep seat tube angle make for a surprisingly efficient pedaling position for such a capable descender. Internal cable routing comes courtesy of thin carbon fiber tubes molded into the frame from entry to exit, ensuring completely integrated, hassle-free routing every time.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber.

Equally at home in the Trans-Provence as it was on The Ridge, updating and improving it was going to be no small feat.\r\n\r\nThe most visible upgrade is the completely new VPP® link arrangement.  The lower link tucks neatly above the bottom bracket, fully-recessed and protected from impacts.  Meanwhile the box-section upper link now mounts cleanly to the top-tube and enhances lateral stiffness as a result. Shock rate’s been refined in the process too, delivering greater small bump sensitivity and a more progressive mid-stroke.\r\n\r\nGeometry has also evolved subtly to meet demand from riders for a bike of this ilk.  The seat tube angle’s been steepened, placing the rider right above the cranks and perfectly in position to lay down the power. Meanwhile a one-degree slacker 66 degree head tube angle combines with a 20-25mm longer top tube and shorter chainstay length to create an evermore rally-ready geometry than its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber.

Hightower’s 67° head angle, longer reach and trim chain stays combine to create an altogether different class of dreadnought in any configuration.  Meanwhile, 150mm of seat dropper, a water bottle mount, and internal routing reflect an armada of killer details.\r\n\r\n135mm of VPP® travel is reinforced by a 148 rear axle spacing and the kind of Nomad-style linkage arrangement and swingarm design we reserve for the heaviest hitters in our model line up.

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"By integrating the requests of our team riders with the demands of our engineers, we’ve created our most spectacular hardtail ever. The integration of angular shapes and smooth transitions provides additional torsional stiffness, improved stress distribution and a distinctive look. All cables enter the frame at the head tube and reemerge appropriately, while the port under the bottom bracket serves both to protect the frame and to provide easy access for maintenance. The chain stay is protected from damage by a specially formed plastic sheath. The disconnect brake mount, an innovative technical feature already proven on the GHOST RIOT, has been redesigned for use on the Lector . In addition to a point on the seat stay, it is mounted directly to the X12 thru-axle and thus maintains perfect alignment with respect to the brake rotor, with the added benefit of helping to transfer braking forces into the axle instead of the carbon of the frame. The geometry has been refined with one goal in mind, better agility and more precise handling. The 31.6 mm seat tube diameter also gives you the option of using a dropper seat post, as some on the World Cup now do, letting you ride even more aggressively in technical terrain. LECTOR is back and killing it. "[0m,

Efficiency is taken another step further with our proprietary Brain technology at the fork and rear shock. This intelligent system is able to interpret the difference between rider and trail input, so it stays firm under effort and compliant over bumps. Then there's our XC 29 Geometry that's built for sheer speed over long courses which, after four ABSA Cape Epic wins and multiple World Championships, has truly earned its salt.

Given the choice, we'll take the latter. That's why we constructed the Epic Comp from our lightweight, stiff, and reliable M5 aluminum, while the geo follows our XC 29 Geometry for explosive power, incredible speeds, and nimble handling. For the suspension, we included our Brain technology at the rear shock. This intelligent system is able to interprets the difference between rider and trail input, so it stays firm under effort and plush over bumps. And for the build, you'll find a mix of Shimano & SRAM 2x10 components that deliver a wide range of gears, dependable performance, and the assurance of durability for season after season of use."[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"It is nothing less than the homecoming of a legend. With the new NINETY-SIX, MERIDA proudly presents the second generation of one of the most successful XC full suspensions of all time.\r\n\r\nOriginally launched for the 2007 season, already the prototype of the first NINETY-SIX showed of what it would be capable. Shortly before serial production, one of the last test versions was pedaled by the MULATIVAN MERIDA BIKING TEAM to a spectacular second place at the Cross Country World Championships – simply the perfect accolade. Later it received numerous recommendations and awards worldwide, among them the prestigious “Milestone Award” from renowned German magazine “BIKE” – before passing the torch to its successor NINETY-NINE in 2011.\r\n\r\nThe backdrop to the switch to a new model at that time was that double-chainring drivetrains started to dominate especially the XC World Cup racing circuit. With the NINETY-SIX kinematically being a child of the triple-chainring era, its successor was developed around the new system. One year later, MERIDA responded to the increasing use of big wheels on the international racing tracks and presented a state-of-the-art 29er.\r\n\r\nBut the world of mountain biking kept on changing, and just like our MULTIVAN MERIDA BIKING TEAM, we also like to keep moving. Another chainring has vanished from XC racing by now, and 1x11 drivetrains are radically changing how we build mountain bikes in general. With the brand-new NINETY-SIX, the future is already here. Geometrically and kinematically optimized for single chainring set ups, this bike is ready to face the challenges of elite XC racing head on.\r\n\r\nIts stellar weight and superb pedaling efficiency are accompanied by the relocation of the rear shock to below the top tube, which makes for a very direct linkage. This position also allows for the remote lockout to be used perfectly. With new technologies like the “Smart Entry” clamped internal routing of all cables (also Di2) and “Race Link” suspension, the name NINETY-SIX again stands for one of the most exiting bikes in the XC World Cup. Thanks to 29er and 27.5” wheel size options for different frame sizes, it also stands for incredible versatility"[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"The prologue to the Nomad Carbon CC XX1 Complete Mountain Bike's story is the 65-degree head tube, which sits just one degree steeper than the dual-crown V10 and makes for a long, stable wheelbase that comes within two inches of Santa Cruz's dedicated DH sled. That makes the Nomad's story seem pretty straightforward at first, but the subsequent chapters flesh-out and complicate it. These complications include putting the emphasis on power transfer with a steep seat tube angle and chainstays virtually on par with the Bronson and almost rivaling the nimble 5010 for stubbiness. Add to this 6.5in of travel, and the Nomad begins to resemble the bridge between DH, enduro, and trail bikes, a truly novel approach to an all-mountain rig.\r\n\r\nIf the Nomad's geometry recommends it for all-mountain chaos, then the light, stiff Carbon CC frame construction means that chaos isn't limited to just DH. It may not be a featherweight climber, but with a claimed frame weight of around 2,800g, it's not that far off the mark. The frame returns in 2016 with the same material and build as 2015's top Nomad model, which means that it remains Santa Cruz's best. For the CC build, the engineers use a higher modulus carbon than the Carbon C model, so less material is required to hit the same strength and stiffness numbers. Less material equates to less weight, and, well, you can see where we're going with this. Climbing and pure speed both benefit when there's less mass for your engine to propel.\r\n\r\nThe frame's two carbon triangles are built as whole pieces rather than glued together from disparate bits. This saves weight and increases structural integrity by allowing Santa Cruz to wrap carbon continuously through and around key junctures. This method reinforces the frame with less material while eliminating the artificial stress points that result from bonded construction methods. Finally, the carbon is also compacted from the inside and the outside for a more even finish that avoids any structural defects, excess material build-up, and resin pooling for — you guessed it — even more weight savings.\r\n\r\nAll that carbon goodness meets at a VPP suspension platform, which returns for the new model year with the same improved mid-stroke support and small bump compliance that maintains snappy pedaling to take advantage of the stiff, lightweight chassis and relatively stubby chainstays while piloting the Nomad's 6.5in of travel to the top of your favorite runs. The system's two counter-rotating links yield a vertical wheel path in initial travel to maintain a firm pedaling feel over small bumps and climbs. As the bike compresses deeper into the suspension, the axle moves rearward to accommodate big hits for extra margin of error when you’re experimenting with the Nomad's long, low geometry on the ragged edge of control.\r\n\r\nDespite the frame's enduro posture, the Nomad's XX1 build kit looks more like something we'd expect to find on a professional XC rig. SRAM's one-by trump card, XX1, gets the nod for the entire drivetrain save the Race Face SIXC Carbon crankset. The combination of weight savings, durable simplicity, and a generous 10-42t cassette range all complement the Nomad's versatile, all-mountain tendencies. The wheels feature Easton's new ARC 27 rims laced to DT Swiss's 240s hubs, whose fast engagement plays a key role in popping the Nomad over a rocky crux move before dropping in and laying waste."[0m,

This creates a uniquely playful character and an insatiable appetite for negotiating steep, rocky climbs.\r\n\r\nAnd when it’s time to head home, playtime becomes a riot. The new 5010 has a 67-degree head tube angle, more aggressive than before, and the longer top tube welcomes the use of shorter stems for more precise handling and greater confidence on rapid descents. The 5010 also shares all the latest VPP® hardware with the new Bronson. The top-tube-mounted, box-section upper link is a leap forward in durability and stiffness, and the lower link rests cleanly out of the way, dramatically improving clearance and minimizing rock strikes.\r\n\r\nBike choice can be a numbers game, but if your game is conquering epic trails then 5010 is the only number you need know. \r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves off more than half a pound from the frame. \r\n\r\nFox 34 Float Factory Kashima 130 Fork\r\nSRAM XX1 Eagle Derailleur\r\nSRAM Guide Ultimate Brakes\r\nSRAM XX1 Eagle; 32t Cranks"[0m,

Since its birth on the drawing board, the KTM development team had only one focus: \"we want to improve in every single detail!\" Therefore the Fully is a perfect match for the following characteristics: more propulsion, more rigidity, more traction and more efficiency with a reduction in weight.\r\nThe 2016 Scarp is a completely new frame, which is based on the →Straight–Line–Link→ (SLL) in combination with our Rocker Blade. This technology offers a very sensitive response to small bumps and a high absorption of big hits while keeping high pedaling efficiency. To conclusively accomplish the concept of the →Straight Line–Link→ Technology (SLL), we deliberately set no bearing point at the dropout, which maximizes stiffness. An improved bike handling was realized through a more flat head tube angle, steeper seat tube angle and longer top tube combined with a shorter stem.

If you've ever ridden a fat bike, you already know how they combine the best aspects of a hard tail and a full-suspension bike into one machine. If you've never ridden one, then rest assured that once you do, you'll wonder if it might be the only off-road bike you need. \r\nThe full alloy frame is stiff and lightweight with a rigid tail for faster accelerations and improved handling. The RockShox Bluto RL 26\" suspension fork with 150mm of travel and 15mm thru axle dropout helps take the sting out of a trail and improves front end rigidity. The real stars of the show though are the KTM FAT Line 26\" wheels wrapped up in massive Schwalbe Jumbo Jim 80mm wide tires. These big, fat aggressive tires add a suspension-like quality to the ride without sacrificing pedaling efficiency, while giving you the ability to roll over pretty much anything in your path. \r\nShifting duties fall to SRAM X9 shifters and derailleurs for crisp, dependable shifting every time. The SRAM X9 double crank set helps keep the weight low, and the crank arms stiff for an easier to manage ride. Shimano Deore M615 hydraulic disc brakes help slow down your fat bike roll with some of the best disc braking performance in the business. Finally, KTM alloy components and a Selle Italia Q-Bik saddle round out the components package."[0m,

The Lycan LT is built around a long travel alloy frame--which is durable, stiff and very lightweight. It's a bike that can tackle just about any terrain you throw it at, and survive to tell the tale, while still letting you have with the pack when it's time to pin on a race number.\r\nBut of course handling some gnarly terrain isn't easy without an excellent suspension system to back it up--which is why the Lycan LT is equipped with a RockShox PIKE RC, 27.5” suspension fork. This bad boy gives you 160mm of travel to let the bike take some huge hits, and a 15mm thru axle that helps stiffen up the front end and keep everything aligned. In the rear RockShox Monarch RT-D2\r\nLockout w/o Remote suspension helps keep you comfortable on any terrain. Fork remote gives you the ability to lock out the suspension to improve pedaling efficiency or make climbing easier.\r\nA full Shimano Shimano Deore XT M8000 drivetrain delivers some of the smoothest and most reliable shifting in the business. This 2x11 drivetrain benefits from plenty of trickle down tech from Shimano's fabled XT group, for crisp dependable shifting. Shimano Deore XT M8000 Ice-Tec brakes provide the best stopping power you'll find anywhere. A great drivetrain demands prime components, which is why the bike rolls on DT Team 27.5\" tubeless rims laced to DT Swiss hubs, all wrapped up in a Schwalbe Hans Dampf TrailStar front tire, and a Schwalbe Rock Razor PaceStar rear tire. Topping things off is a Fizi:k Nisene saddle, and Kindshoc LEV-DX hydraulic adjustable 100/125mm dropper post."[0m,

It blends strength with efficiency, so it has an M5 alloy construction and an X1 setup, plus a 150mm Pike RC fork that complements a snappy, trail-eating geometry.\r\n\r\nIf you're riding hard on the trail, a 650b is going to complement your playful style. After all, it's pretty difficult to beat the agility and responsiveness that the wheel size brings to the table. So to support your style of riding, we made the Stumpjumper Elite 650b. It features an M5 alloy construction that's lightweight, durable, and plenty stiff. Adding to this philosophy of blending strength and efficiency, the Elite 29 is equipped with SRAM's workhorse one-by groupset, X1, and Shimano's dependable SLX hydraulic disc. And when you factor in our proprietary Rx Trail Tune at the shock, plus an aggressive, trail-eating geometry that features absurdly short chainstays, a roomy top tube, a low bottom bracket, and a slacked out front end, you get a trail bike that's ready and able to take on anything that might confront you on the trail.\r\nM5 alloy Trail Chassis with Stumpjumper FSR rear end blends durability, stiffness, and light weight, while 150mm of travel Trail 650b Geometry provide more than capable handling.\r\nConnected with our FSR 6-Pack Linkage, a custom FOX FLOAT Factory rear shock features AUTOSAG for easy setup and 150mm of plush, adjustable suspension, while our Rx Trail Tune provides a more supple, responsive, and efficient feel for climbing up and descending down the trail.\r\nRockShox Pike RC 650b fork features a 15mm Maxle Ultimate thru-axle and 150mm of plush travel to take on big hits and bumpy terrain with supreme confidence and efficiency.\r\n650bx2.3” Specialized Butcher Control front tire inspires confidence through any terrain.\r\n650bx2.3” Specialized Purgatory Control rear tire delivers reliable traction over a diverse section of soils and conditions.\r\nCommand Post IRcc seatpost features 12 positions of up to 125mm of height adjustability for a more customizable position, ultimately resulting in more control and increased handling on both climbs and descents."[0m,

Like its counterpart \"standard\" version, it's constructed from our finest carbon fiber and features a drool-worthy build kit and a RockShox RS-1 Brain fork. But where it differs is in its tighter geometry and one-by-specific build, which work together to form explosive power transfer and an even nimbler sense of handling. Along these lines, you'll find that the build holds nothing back, delivering a SRAM XX1 groupset that's lightweight and intuitive, along with XTR brakes for some of the best stopping power in the business. And to drive even harder on efficiency and speed, we included our proprietary Brain technology at the fork and rear shock. This intelligent system is able to interpret the difference between rider and trail input, so it stays firm under effort and plush over bumps. Put it all together, and you have a purpose-built race machine that's certain to lay waste to any short track out there."[0m,

Our Epic Comp Carbon World Cup answers the call with a tighter geometry, along with shorter chainstays and tube lengths in comparison to a \"standard\" Epic. This gives the World Cup more explosive power transfer and nimbler handling, especially when paired up with the carbon chassis and M5 alloy rear end. As for the build, you truly start to see the theme of uncompromising speed at work, as we've hung some of SRAM's most reliable parts on this bike. And to make sure that you'll be utilizing every watt of power out of them, we included our Mini Brain rear shock that differentiates rider input from trail bumps to ensure that the bike stays stiff when you need it to. With all of this going on, it's easy to see why the Epic has long been the dominant force on the cross country scene.\r\n\r\nBy pairing a FACT 9m carbon fiber frame w/ a M5 alloy rear end with our World Cup XC 29 Geometry, this Epic places a focus on tight tube angles and light overall weight for explosive speed and nimble handling on the race circuit.\r\nCustom FOX/ Specialized remote Mini Brain rear shock features AUTOSAG for easy set up and 95mm of fine-tunable suspension. To maximize efficiency, the proprietary design allows the shock to differentiate rider input and trail bumps, so the suspension feels firm under effort and plush over rough terrain.\r\nA RockShox Reba RL 29 fork offers up 100mm of smooth travel, while an easily accessible compression and rebound adjusts permit you to customize the feel according to the terrain at hand.\r\nRoval 29 alloy wheels feature a 21mm internal width, making them plenty stiff and lightweight for XC racing.\r\nThe drivetrain is comprised of a mix of SRAM 1x11 components, hand-selected to provide maximum performance at a more palatable value. Combine, the GX and S-1000 pieces deliver crisp shifting, stiff pedaling, and reliable precision—no matter what direction you're pointing the bike on the trail."[0m,

It's made from our finest carbon fiber, and it's built off of our revolutionary XC 29 Geometry for explosive power, incredible climbing prowess, and nimble handling. At the rear, the hardtail design with razor thin seatstays blends maximum pedaling efficiency with added compliance. Add to this our Brain technology at the RockShox RS-1 fork that differentiates between rider and trail input to stay firm under effort and compliant over bumps, a venerable SRAM XX1 groupset with Shimano XTR brakes, and hand-built carbon wheels, and you have a bike that sacrifices nothing in the pursuit of speed.\r\n\r\nTo provide the optimal blend of stiffness, light weight, and strength, we constructed the frame from our FACT 11m carbon fiber. And when combined with our XC 29 Geometry, the Stumpjumper is guaranteed to deliver uncompromising, blistering speed come race day—no matter the course.\r\nRockShox RS-1 Brain fork is arguably the most sought-after fork in XC racing. Compared to a traditional fork, its inverted design creates a carbon fiber upper that provides superior stiffness, while behaving with more sensitivity to small bumps and more control over larger hits. And with Brain technology, these characteristics are amplified and even more efficient. It also includes our Spike Valve technology that minimizes yaw in cornering, while providing maximum travel in high velocity impacts.\r\nRoval Control SL 29 carbon fiber wheels are lightweight for climbs, hand-built for precision and durability, stiff for explosive sprints and nimble handling, and most importantly, exceptionally fast for hard, sustained efforts come race day.\r\nCasing the wheels are 29x2.0\" S-Works Fast Trak tires at the front and rear. Together, the tires provide a heightened level of fast-rolling traction and reliable protection that's well suited to the rigors of cross country racing.\r\nThe one-by drivetrain is controlled by SRAM's venerable XX1 components, while shifting duties are handled by a Shimano XTR carbon lever. Combined, the system forms the ultimate in efficiency and intuitive feel, while also having the added benefit of significant weight savings and minimal required maintenance."[0m,

Add to this our Brain technology at the RockShox RS-1 fork that differentiates between rider and trail input to stay firm under effort and compliant over bumps, hand-built carbon wheels, and the reliable performance of a SRAM X01 drivetrain, and you have a bike that's ready for any XC course or ribbon of singletrack.\r\n\r\nBy pairing a FACT 10m carbon fiber frame with our World Cup XC 29 Geometry, this Stumpjumper places a focus on tight tube angles and light overall weight for explosive speed and nimble handling on the race circuit.\r\nRockShox RS-1 Brain fork is arguably the most sought-after fork in XC racing. Compared to a traditional fork, its inverted design creates a carbon fiber upper that provides superior stiffness, while behaving with more sensitivity to small bumps and more control over larger hits. And with Brain technology, these characteristics are amplified and even more efficient. It also includes our Spike Valve technology that minimizes yaw in cornering, while providing maximum travel in high velocity impacts.\r\nRoval Control Carbon 29 wheels are lightweight and hand-built to deliver sheer speed on climbs and sprints, while the 27mm external width lends itself to ample control and nimbleness on technical descents.\r\nCasing the wheels are 29x2.0\" S-Works Fast Trak tires at the front and rear. Together, the tires provide a heightened level of fast-rolling traction and reliable protection that's well suited to the rigors of cross country racing.\r\nSRAM's X01 groupset features a wide gear range that delivers climbing and descending efficiency in spades. On top of this, the one-by setup, driven by the 30T S-2200 crankset, is notorious for being next to impossible to drop a chain with, plus it provides a significant weight savings in comparison to a standard two-by setup."[0m,

The down tube, seat stays and even the bottom bracket hiding the cables and wires, protecting them from external influences. The Disconnect Brake Mount brake mounting is an innovative technical solution with out-towering design that has already proven itself with the GHOST RIOT and has been optimized again. The rear brake is directly connected to the X12 axle system with the LECTOR ULC models and protects the frame against thermal and mechanical loads while using less total weight. The geometry has also been refined. Shorter head tubes and chainstays provide more agility and more direct handling.

The down tube, seat stays and even the bottom bracket hiding the cables and wires, protecting them from external influences. The Disconnect Brake Mount brake mounting is an innovative technical solution with out-towering design that has already proven itself with the GHOST RIOT and has been optimized again. The rear brake is directly connected to the X12 axle system with the LECTOR ULC models and protects the frame against thermal and mechanical loads while using less total weight. The geometry has also been refined. Shorter head tubes and chainstays provide more agility and more direct handling. In World Cup proved: 31.6 mm seat tube diameters allow the use of telescopic seatpost and thus more aggressive positions and maneuvers. The LECTOR is back - and it's faster than ever. "[0m,

One look at the terrain tells you why – it’s rough, steep and more worthy of being a World Cup DH course than an enduro stage. Under these circumstances, the Nomad’s aggressive 65-degree head angle delivers V10 handling at Syndicate speeds. 165mm of VPP™ travel is delivered via a V10-style upper link and neatly recessed lower link design that's been extended to the Bronson and 5010.\r\n\r\nThe Nomad is uncompromising in its purpose, and as such has been designed specifically around one-by drivetrains only.  One-by offers a wide range of  options for just about any kind of riding, and the design permits some seriously compact chainstays.  On the front end of the bike, the rangy cockpit and relatively steep seat tube angle make for a surprisingly efficient pedaling position for such a capable descender. Internal cable routing comes courtesy of thin carbon fiber tubes molded into the frame from entry to exit, ensuring completely integrated, hassle-free routing every time.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves off more than half a pound from the frame.  \r\n\r\nSRAM’s more cost-effective one-by group, DT Swiss hubs, Reverb Stealth post\r\nRockshox Pike RCT3 160 Fork\r\nSRAM X01 Derailleur\r\nSRAM Guide RSC Brakes\r\nRaceface Turbine, 32t Cranks"[0m,

Además incluye una pipa de dirección forjada de 1,5 pulgadas para mejorar la mayoría de estas cualidades. En cuanto a su comportamiento, la Demo 8 combina nuestra Geometría S3 con un diseño asimétrico del cuadro que garantiza un fácil acceso al amortiguador, gran espacio libre en el tubo superior para un mayor control, vainas ultra- cortas que proporcionan agilidad, un pedalier bajo que mantiene la sensación de aplomo y estabilidad y un ángulo de dirección holgado para ofrecer la máxima manejabilidad y sensibilidad a alta velocidad. Para la suspensión, esta Demo cuenta con 200 mm de recorrido delante gracias a una horquilla RockShox BOXXER RC 650b y 200 mm detrás controlados por FOX VAN RC con ajuste personalizado. En conjunto, esta combinación asegura que seas capaz de surcar cualquier terreno con total confianza.

To further guarantee it, you'll find that the double-ring crankset ensures a wide range of climbing gears. And to make sure that it performs on the descents, as well, we equipped it with a tried-and-true RockShox Reba RL 29 fork and razor thin seatstays for added compliance. Combine that with our built-for-speed XC 29 Geometry, a build kit with a focus on strength and precision, and a lightweight, responsive M5 alloy frame, and this Stumpjumper becomes an obvious choice for anyone who wants speed without the fuss."[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"When the time came to examine whether to give the V10 27.5-inch wheels, we turned to the Syndicate, who rode the prototypes, gave us feedback, and ultimately raced the bike on the World Cup circuit. By the time the season was over, the new bike had garnered the 2014 World Cup title, and a World Champs medal. Those accolades speak for themselves, but we were eager to improve.\r\n\r\nDrawing on feedback from Peat, Minnaar and Bryceland on their personal settings, the 6th generation of our flagship model now offers 216mm / 8.5” of travel in two adjustable geometry positions:\r\nHigh: 64° headtube angle / 360mm bottom bracket height.\r\nLow: 63.5° headtube angle / 353mm bottom bracket height.\r\n\r\nThe shock rate has been tuned to be more linear and deliver  consistent damping throughout the travel. Carbon lay-up analysis and frame shape optimization allowed for more efficient use of material, and the savings were then reinvested into other areas to ensure the bike withstands Ratboy’s huge flat landings.  The front triangle and swingarm sport larger-diameter sections, but we’ll refrain from the usual drone about the positive effect that has on strength and stiffness. The new frame benefits from a slightly longer reach to suit evolving rider preferences.  However, our athletes felt we always struck a good balance with our chainstay length, so we focused on maintaining this dimension when accommodating larger wheels.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves nearly a pound from the frame.  \r\n\r\n7-Speed DH kit, Fox fork and shock\r\nFox 40 Float RC2 27.5 Factory Flat Crown Fork\r\nSRAM X01 DH 7-Speed Derailleur\r\nSRAM Guide RSC Brakes\r\nRaceface SIXC Cranks"[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"The Tallboy cuts a whole new swath across the trail bike landscape.\r\n\r\nAs a 27+ bike it revels in the severe. In desert-dry conditions the wider tires float above the dust and find oases of grip where standard tires flounder. And when the monsoon comes, lower tire pressures pull the Tallboy through the slickest of root sections like a Defender on diff-lock.\r\n\r\nIn its 29-inch form, the Tallboy’s renowned rowdy streak comes to the fore. Happy at full gas, up or down hill, the speed and agility of the 29 configuration will have you bagging on e-bikes at every turn.\r\n\r\nA 68 degree head angle and 110mm of VPP travel distills the original Tallboy’s playful character into something all the more mischievous. Longer reach and shorter chainstays fuel that personality, and bring the Tallboy bang up to date with the rest of the Santa Cruz range.\r\n\r\nA flip chip on the upper link, combined with either a 130mm fork (for 27+) or 120mm fork (for 29-inch), ensures geometry remains consistent across a vast range of build kits and sizes, from S to XXL.\r\n\r\nThe versatile trail bike of choice for rapid riders like Greg Minnaar—the Tallboy is for those who don’t roll with the pack. \r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frames, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves off more than half a pound from the frame. \r\n\r\nFox 34 Float 29 Performance Elite Fork\r\nSRAM X01 Derailleur\r\nSRAM Level TLM Brakes\r\nRace Face Turbine; 30t Cranks"[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"When we introduced Bronson, it took the market by storm, redefining what people expected from a 150mm trail bike. Equally at home in the Trans-Provence as it was on The Ridge, updating and improving it was going to be no small feat.\r\n\r\nThe most visible upgrade is the completely new VPP® link arrangement.  The lower link tucks neatly above the bottom bracket, fully-recessed and protected from impacts.  Meanwhile the box-section upper link now mounts cleanly to the top-tube and enhances lateral stiffness as a result. Shock rate’s been refined in the process too, delivering greater small bump sensitivity and a more progressive mid-stroke.\r\n\r\nGeometry has also evolved subtly to meet demand from riders for a bike of this ilk.  The seat tube angle’s been steepened, placing the rider right above the cranks and perfectly in position to lay down the power. Meanwhile a one-degree slacker 66 degree head tube angle combines with a 20-25mm longer top tube and shorter chainstay length to create an evermore rally-ready geometry than its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves off more than half a pound from the frame.  \r\n\r\nRock Shox Pike RCT3 150 Solo Air Fork\r\nShimano XT M8000 GS Derailleur\r\nShimano XT Brakes\r\nRace Face Turbine SL, 24/34 Cranks"[0m,

It’s fast, light, unapologetically simple, and a blast to ride. When it came time to redesign the Superlight, we wanted to make a bike that fit each rider’s size and weight as well as possible. The result is that the small and medium sizes utilize higher shock leverage ratios to ensure lighter riders make effective use of the travel.  We also used 27.5\" wheels in the small and medium sizes to improve handling and create industry-leading standover height for shorter riders.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the large and extra-large sizes come with 29\" wheels so that taller riders benefit from the rolling advantages of that wheel size. All sizes sport 100mm of single-pivot suspension in an aluminum package that's durable, easy to maintain and perfect for years of hassle-free mountain biking."[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"When the time came to examine whether to give the V10 27.5-inch wheels, we turned to the Syndicate, who rode the prototypes, gave us feedback, and ultimately raced the bike on the World Cup circuit. By the time the season was over, the new bike had garnered the 2014 World Cup title, and a World Champs medal. Those accolades speak for themselves, but we were eager to improve.\r\n\r\nDrawing on feedback from Peat, Minnaar and Bryceland on their personal settings, the 6th generation of our flagship model now offers 216mm / 8.5” of travel in two adjustable geometry positions:\r\nHigh: 64° headtube angle / 360mm bottom bracket height.\r\nLow: 63.5° headtube angle / 353mm bottom bracket height.\r\n\r\nThe shock rate has been tuned to be more linear and deliver  consistent damping throughout the travel. Carbon lay-up analysis and frame shape optimization allowed for more efficient use of material, and the savings were then reinvested into other areas to ensure the bike withstands Ratboy’s huge flat landings.  The front triangle and swingarm sport larger-diameter sections, but we’ll refrain from the usual drone about the positive effect that has on strength and stiffness. The new frame benefits from a slightly longer reach to suit evolving rider preferences.  However, our athletes felt we always struck a good balance with our chainstay length, so we focused on maintaining this dimension when accommodating larger wheels.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves nearly a pound from the frame.  "[0m,

One look at the terrain tells you why – it’s rough, steep and more worthy of being a World Cup DH course than an enduro stage. Under these circumstances, the Nomad’s aggressive 65-degree head angle delivers V10 handling at Syndicate speeds. 165mm of VPP™ travel is delivered via a V10-style upper link and neatly recessed lower link design that's been extended to the Bronson and 5010.\r\n\r\nThe Nomad is uncompromising in its purpose, and as such has been designed specifically around one-by drivetrains only.  One-by offers a wide range of  options for just about any kind of riding, and the design permits some seriously compact chainstays.  On the front end of the bike, the rangy cockpit and relatively steep seat tube angle make for a surprisingly efficient pedaling position for such a capable descender. Internal cable routing comes courtesy of thin carbon fiber tubes molded into the frame from entry to exit, ensuring completely integrated, hassle-free routing every time.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber.

Equally at home in the Trans-Provence as it was on The Ridge, updating and improving it was going to be no small feat.\r\n\r\nThe most visible upgrade is the completely new VPP® link arrangement.  The lower link tucks neatly above the bottom bracket, fully-recessed and protected from impacts.  Meanwhile the box-section upper link now mounts cleanly to the top-tube and enhances lateral stiffness as a result. Shock rate’s been refined in the process too, delivering greater small bump sensitivity and a more progressive mid-stroke.\r\n\r\nGeometry has also evolved subtly to meet demand from riders for a bike of this ilk.  The seat tube angle’s been steepened, placing the rider right above the cranks and perfectly in position to lay down the power. Meanwhile a one-degree slacker 66 degree head tube angle combines with a 20-25mm longer top tube and shorter chainstay length to create an evermore rally-ready geometry than its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber.

Upgrade to carbon rims and you have a precision instrument on your hands. \r\n\r\n27.5+\r\n​When conditions get loose and the traction just ain’t there, you’ll want to reach for bigger tires. 27.5+ elevates Hightower to a whole different level, enabling you to rise above the pow, rail the soft spots and carry momentum where standard tires bog down.\r\n\r\nNo matter what size you run, geometry remains optimized thanks to a neat little “High/Low” setting on the upper link that flips to adjust bottom bracket height*.  Hightower’s 67° head angle, longer reach and trim chain stays combine to create an altogether different class of dreadnought in any configuration.  Meanwhile, 150mm of seat dropper, a water bottle mount, and internal routing reflect an armada of killer details.\r\n\r\n135mm of VPP® travel is reinforced by a 148 rear axle spacing and the kind of Nomad-style linkage arrangement and swingarm design we reserve for the heaviest hitters in our model line up.  The resulting package leaves Hightower standing head and shoulders above anything else out there. \r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 230 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves off half a pound from the frame.  \r\n\r\n*Please note: 140mm fork comes standard on the 29” kits, and is exchanged for a 150mm version on the 27+ builds to keep the 67° head angle consistent."[0m,

Yes, it’s time for you to jump beyond that first “real” bike, maybe past the hardtail you’ve lovingly abused beyond its capabilities. Enter the Occam AM H50, built to give you the best mountain biking experience at the best value, especially with a Hydro alloy frame, RockShox fork, Fox rear shock, and Shimano drivetrain. The Occam uses complex technology to bring you a simple experience. You won’t find a dozen bearings or complex linkages driving a strange proprietary shock. Rather, a startlingly light, remarkably stiff and cleverly-engineered piece of technology designed to last a lifetime. Keep the fun going with the Occam AM H50."[0m,

All cables enter the frame at the head tube and reemerge appropriately, while the port under the bottom bracket serves both to protect the frame and to provide easy access for maintenance. The chain stay is protected from damage by a specially formed plastic sheath. The disconnect brake mount, an innovative technical feature already proven on the GHOST RIOT, has been redesigned for use on the Lector . In addition to a point on the seat stay, it is mounted directly to the X12 thru-axle and thus maintains perfect alignment with respect to the brake rotor, with the added benefit of helping to transfer braking forces into the axle instead of the carbon of the frame. The geometry has been refined with one goal in mind, better agility and more precise handling. The 31.6 mm seat tube diameter also gives you the option of using a dropper seat post, as some on the World Cup now do, letting you ride even more aggressively in technical terrain. LECTOR is back and killing it. "[0m,

The chain stay is protected from damage by a specially formed plastic sheath. The disconnect brake mount, an innovative technical feature already proven on the GHOST RIOT, has been redesigned for use on the Lector . In addition to a point on the seat stay, it is mounted directly to the X12 thru-axle and thus maintains perfect alignment with respect to the brake rotor, with the added benefit of helping to transfer braking forces into the axle instead of the carbon of the frame. The geometry has been refined with one goal in mind, better agility and more precise handling. The 31.6 mm seat tube diameter also gives you the option of using a dropper seat post, as some on the World Cup now do, letting you ride even more aggressively in technical terrain.

For the suspension, we included our Brain technology at the rear shock. This intelligent system is able to interprets the difference between rider and trail input, so it stays firm under effort and plush over bumps.

Our Rhyme FSR Comp 6Fattie, however, is guaranteed to take your trail riding to the next level—all without breaking the bank. We included size-specific components to completely tailor the bike to women. Then, of course, came the debut of our all-new 6Fattie Wheel System. It takes 650b wheels and wraps them in 3.0\" tires in order to achieve levels of traction, control, and floatation that'll shake your idea of trail riding to the core. And when you combine a mix of SRAM and Shimano's most durable components with our control-boosting 6Fattie Trail Geometry and a pressure-relieving Body Geometry Myth saddle, we're confident that you're looking at the future of trail bikes."[0m,

Shortly before serial production, one of the last test versions was pedaled by the MULATIVAN MERIDA BIKING TEAM to a spectacular second place at the Cross Country World Championships – simply the perfect accolade. Later it received numerous recommendations and awards worldwide, among them the prestigious “Milestone Award” from renowned German magazine “BIKE” – before passing the torch to its successor NINETY-NINE in 2011.\r\n\r\nThe backdrop to the switch to a new model at that time was that double-chainring drivetrains started to dominate especially the XC World Cup racing circuit. With the NINETY-SIX kinematically being a child of the triple-chainring era, its successor was developed around the new system. One year later, MERIDA responded to the increasing use of big wheels on the international racing tracks and presented a state-of-the-art 29er.\r\n\r\nBut the world of mountain biking kept on changing, and just like our MULTIVAN MERIDA BIKING TEAM, we also like to keep moving. Another chainring has vanished from XC racing by now, and 1x11 drivetrains are radically changing how we build mountain bikes in general. With the brand-new NINETY-SIX, the future is already here. Geometrically and kinematically optimized for single chainring set ups, this bike is ready to face the challenges of elite XC racing head on.\r\n\r\nIts stellar weight and superb pedaling efficiency are accompanied by the relocation of the rear shock to below the top tube, which makes for a very direct linkage. This position also allows for the remote lockout to be used perfectly. With new technologies like the “Smart Entry” clamped internal routing of all cables (also Di2) and “Race Link” suspension, the name NINETY-SIX again stands for one of the most exiting bikes in the XC World Cup. Thanks to 29er and 27.5” wheel size options for different frame sizes, it also stands for incredible versatility"[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"The prologue to the Nomad Carbon CC XX1 Complete Mountain Bike's story is the 65-degree head tube, which sits just one degree steeper than the dual-crown V10 and makes for a long, stable wheelbase that comes within two inches of Santa Cruz's dedicated DH sled. That makes the Nomad's story seem pretty straightforward at first, but the subsequent chapters flesh-out and complicate it. These complications include putting the emphasis on power transfer with a steep seat tube angle and chainstays virtually on par with the Bronson and almost rivaling the nimble 5010 for stubbiness. Add to this 6.5in of travel, and the Nomad begins to resemble the bridge between DH, enduro, and trail bikes, a truly novel approach to an all-mountain rig.\r\n\r\nIf the Nomad's geometry recommends it for all-mountain chaos, then the light, stiff Carbon CC frame construction means that chaos isn't limited to just DH. It may not be a featherweight climber, but with a claimed frame weight of around 2,800g, it's not that far off the mark. The frame returns in 2016 with the same material and build as 2015's top Nomad model, which means that it remains Santa Cruz's best. For the CC build, the engineers use a higher modulus carbon than the Carbon C model, so less material is required to hit the same strength and stiffness numbers. Less material equates to less weight, and, well, you can see where we're going with this. Climbing and pure speed both benefit when there's less mass for your engine to propel.\r\n\r\nThe frame's two carbon triangles are built as whole pieces rather than glued together from disparate bits. This saves weight and increases structural integrity by allowing Santa Cruz to wrap carbon continuously through and around key junctures. This method reinforces the frame with less material while eliminating the artificial stress points that result from bonded construction methods. Finally, the carbon is also compacted from the inside and the outside for a more even finish that avoids any structural defects, excess material build-up, and resin pooling for — you guessed it — even more weight savings.\r\n\r\nAll that carbon goodness meets at a VPP suspension platform, which returns for the new model year with the same improved mid-stroke support and small bump compliance that maintains snappy pedaling to take advantage of the stiff, lightweight chassis and relatively stubby chainstays while piloting the Nomad's 6.5in of travel to the top of your favorite runs. The system's two counter-rotating links yield a vertical wheel path in initial travel to maintain a firm pedaling feel over small bumps and climbs. As the bike compresses deeper into the suspension, the axle moves rearward to accommodate big hits for extra margin of error when you’re experimenting with the Nomad's long, low geometry on the ragged edge of control.\r\n\r\nDespite the frame's enduro posture, the Nomad's XX1 build kit looks more like something we'd expect to find on a professional XC rig. SRAM's one-by trump card, XX1, gets the nod for the entire drivetrain save the Race Face SIXC Carbon crankset. The combination of weight savings, durable simplicity, and a generous 10-42t cassette range all complement the Nomad's versatile, all-mountain tendencies. The wheels feature Easton's new ARC 27 rims laced to DT Swiss's 240s hubs, whose fast engagement plays a key role in popping the Nomad over a rocky crux move before dropping in and laying waste."[0m,

This creates a uniquely playful character and an insatiable appetite for negotiating steep, rocky climbs.\r\n\r\nAnd when it’s time to head home, playtime becomes a riot. The new 5010 has a 67-degree head tube angle, more aggressive than before, and the longer top tube welcomes the use of shorter stems for more precise handling and greater confidence on rapid descents. The 5010 also shares all the latest VPP® hardware with the new Bronson. The top-tube-mounted, box-section upper link is a leap forward in durability and stiffness, and the lower link rests cleanly out of the way, dramatically improving clearance and minimizing rock strikes.\r\n\r\nBike choice can be a numbers game, but if your game is conquering epic trails then 5010 is the only number you need know. \r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves off more than half a pound from the frame. \r\n\r\nFox 34 Float Factory Kashima 130 Fork\r\nSRAM XX1 Eagle Derailleur\r\nSRAM Guide Ultimate Brakes\r\nSRAM XX1 Eagle; 32t Cranks"[0m,

Designed with a sloping top tube, and more comfortable geometry, the Aera 27 Pro is a no-nonsense ride that delivers up serious performance, thanks to a great performance carbon fiber frame and a competition-ready component selection. The Aera’s carbon fiber frame is stiff, fast and lightweight--making it the perfect XC racer. But this is no fragile eggshell of a bike, it's been engineered for durability and toughness to stand up to even the most demanding trail. Up front, a RockShox Reba RL suspension fork with 100mm of travel helps keep everything super stiff while absorbing enough of the rough stuff to let you be less choosy with your line.\r\nA full Shimano Deore XT M8000 11-speed drivetrain delivers some of the smoothest and most reliable shifting in the business. This 2x11 drivetrain benefits from plenty of trickle down tech from Shimano's fabled XTR group, for crisp dependable shifting. Shimano M506 hydraulic brakes provide the best stopping power you'll find anywhere. Rounding out the build is set of KTM Line CC 27.5\" rims, laced to Shimano Deore hubs. All wrapped with Schwalbe Rocket Ron Evo 27x2.25\" tires. Topping the bike is a Selle Italia X1 Flow saddle, with a KTM 27.2mm alloy seat post. "[0m,

You could say it's the ultimate adventure bike. With a high performance alloy frame that's stiff, lightweight and durable and a Suntour SF15 XCT suspension fork with 100mm of suspension travel to take the sting out of light trail riding or rough roads. Shifting duties are handled by a Shimano Acera 3x8 drivetrain that gives you 24 speeds to choose from, while stopping is accomplished via Shimano M355 hydraulic disc brakes, which offer powerful stopping performance in nearly any weather.\r\nThe KTM Chicago 27.24 Disc H features a set of 27.5\" wheels mounted with huge Ruben V85 Ocelot tires coming in at 2.1\" inches wide. So go ahead and plan your next adventure--even if it's just to the office. You never know where the Chicago might take you. "[0m,

This technology offers a very sensitive response to small bumps and a high absorption of big hits, while keeping high pedaling efficiency. The development team invested a lot of time to shape the rocker blade extremely rigid to torsion. To conclusively accomplish the concept of the Straight–Line–Link Technology (SLL), we deliberately set no bearing point at the dropout, which maximizes stiffness. Through this suspension-system the Fully achieves an astonishing amount of propulsion in the 125 mm class, which was originally reserved for Racefullies. The compact and rigid front triangle with its sloping geometry ensures a lower stand-over height.

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"The 2016 Lycan has transformed into a weapon for marathons in its last stage of development. The latest stroke of genius from KTM Bike Industries is called Straight–Line–Link (SLL). In combination with the Rocker Blade, it revolutionizes the concept of rear suspensions. This technology offers a very sensitive response to small bumps and a high absorption of big hits, while keeping high pedaling efficiency. The development team invested a lot of time to shape the rocker blade extremely rigid to torsion. To conclusively accomplish the concept of the Straight–Line–Link Technology (SLL), we deliberately set no bearing point at the dropout, which maximizes stiffness. Through this suspension-system the Fully achieves an astonishing amount of propulsion in the 125 mm class, which was originally reserved for Racefullies. The compact and rigid front triangle with its sloping geometry ensures a lower stand-over height. An improved bike handling was realized through a more flat head tube angle, steeper seat tube angle and longer top tube combined with shorter stem. To add the final touch to this harmonious concept, the ball bearings are bigger dimensions which results in better strength and durability."[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"The KTM Fat Rat is a fat bike that blends the legendary versatility these bikes are known for, with the performance advantages of a high-end mountain bike. If you've ever ridden a fat bike, you already know how they combine the best aspects of a hard tail and a full-suspension bike into one machine. If you've never ridden one, then rest assured that once you do, you'll wonder if it might be the only off-road bike you need. \r\nThe full alloy frame is stiff and lightweight with a rigid tail for faster accelerations and improved handling. The RockShox Bluto RL 26\" suspension fork with 150mm of travel and 15mm thru axle dropout helps take the sting out of a trail and improves front end rigidity. The real stars of the show though are the KTM FAT Line 26\" wheels wrapped up in massive Schwalbe Jumbo Jim 80mm wide tires. These big, fat aggressive tires add a suspension-like quality to the ride without sacrificing pedaling efficiency, while giving you the ability to roll over pretty much anything in your path. \r\nShifting duties fall to SRAM X9 shifters and derailleurs for crisp, dependable shifting every time. The SRAM X9 double crank set helps keep the weight low, and the crank arms stiff for an easier to manage ride. Shimano Deore M615 hydraulic disc brakes help slow down your fat bike roll with some of the best disc braking performance in the business. Finally, KTM alloy components and a Selle Italia Q-Bik saddle round out the components package."[0m,

It's a bike that can tackle just about any terrain you throw it at, and survive to tell the tale, while still letting you have with the pack when it's time to pin on a race number.\r\nBut of course handling some gnarly terrain isn't easy without an excellent suspension system to back it up--which is why the Lycan LT is equipped with a RockShox PIKE RC, 27.5” suspension fork. This bad boy gives you 160mm of travel to let the bike take some huge hits, and a 15mm thru axle that helps stiffen up the front end and keep everything aligned. In the rear RockShox Monarch RT-D2\r\nLockout w/o Remote suspension helps keep you comfortable on any terrain. Fork remote gives you the ability to lock out the suspension to improve pedaling efficiency or make climbing easier.\r\nA full Shimano Shimano Deore XT M8000 drivetrain delivers some of the smoothest and most reliable shifting in the business. This 2x11 drivetrain benefits from plenty of trickle down tech from Shimano's fabled XT group, for crisp dependable shifting. Shimano Deore XT M8000 Ice-Tec brakes provide the best stopping power you'll find anywhere. A great drivetrain demands prime components, which is why the bike rolls on DT Team 27.5\" tubeless rims laced to DT Swiss hubs, all wrapped up in a Schwalbe Hans Dampf TrailStar front tire, and a Schwalbe Rock Razor PaceStar rear tire. Topping things off is a Fizi:k Nisene saddle, and Kindshoc LEV-DX hydraulic adjustable 100/125mm dropper post."[0m,

As for the build, you truly start to see the theme of uncompromising speed at work, as we've hung some of SRAM's most reliable parts on this bike. And to make sure that you'll be utilizing every watt of power out of them, we included our Mini Brain rear shock that differentiates rider input from trail bumps to ensure that the bike stays stiff when you need it to. With all of this going on, it's easy to see why the Epic has long been the dominant force on the cross country scene.\r\n\r\nBy pairing a FACT 9m carbon fiber frame w/ a M5 alloy rear end with our World Cup XC 29 Geometry, this Epic places a focus on tight tube angles and light overall weight for explosive speed and nimble handling on the race circuit.\r\nCustom FOX/ Specialized remote Mini Brain rear shock features AUTOSAG for easy set up and 95mm of fine-tunable suspension. To maximize efficiency, the proprietary design allows the shock to differentiate rider input and trail bumps, so the suspension feels firm under effort and plush over rough terrain.\r\nA RockShox Reba RL 29 fork offers up 100mm of smooth travel, while an easily accessible compression and rebound adjusts permit you to customize the feel according to the terrain at hand.\r\nRoval 29 alloy wheels feature a 21mm internal width, making them plenty stiff and lightweight for XC racing.\r\nThe drivetrain is comprised of a mix of SRAM 1x11 components, hand-selected to provide maximum performance at a more palatable value. Combine, the GX and S-1000 pieces deliver crisp shifting, stiff pedaling, and reliable precision—no matter what direction you're pointing the bike on the trail."[0m,

Or in other words, you need the S-Works Stumpjumper FSR Carbon 29. It reflects everything that we've learned over the years, and in our eyes, represents the pinnacle of trail performance. Starting at the carbon layup, it features our highest-end FACT 11m for an ultra-lightweight, strong, and stiff construction. The carbon molding process also allowed us to revolutionize how you carry your trail essentials with the all-new SWAT Door found at the down tube. This compartment will fit a tube, a tool, and pump without rattling or compromising the structural integrity of the frame. And when you add-in an aggressive, trail-eating geometry that features ridiculously short chainstays, a roomy top tube, a low bottom bracket, and a slacked out front end, our proprietary Rx Trail Tune at the shock, and a build spec that spares no expense, you have a bike that, without a doubt, is ready for anything on the trail.\r\n\r\nFACT 11m carbon fiber Trail Chassis with Stumpjumper FSR full carbon rear end blends stiffness with light weight to form the pinnacle of efficiency, while fully enclosed cable routing and an integrated SWAT Door create exceptional handling and zero-hassle storage.\r\nConnected with our FSR 6-Pack Linkage, a custom FOX FLOAT Factory rear shock features AUTOSAG for easy setup and 135mm of plush, adjustable suspension, while our Rx Trail Tune provides a more supple, responsive, and efficient feel for climbing up and descending down the trail.\r\nRockShox Pike RCT3 29 fork features a 15mm Maxle Ultimate thru-axle and 140mm of plush travel to take on big hits and bumpy terrain with supreme confidence and efficiency.\r\n29x2.3” Specialized Butcher Control front tire inspires confidence through any terrain.\r\n29x2.3” Specialized Purgatory Control rear tire delivers reliable traction over a diverse section of soils and conditions.\r\nCommand Post IRcc seatpost features 12 positions of up to 125mm of height adjustability for a more customizable position, ultimately resulting in more control and increased handling on both climbs and descents."[0m,

It's made from our finest carbon fiber, and it's built off of our revolutionary XC 29 Geometry for explosive power, incredible climbing prowess, and nimble handling. At the rear, the hardtail design with razor thin seatstays blends maximum pedaling efficiency with added compliance. Add to this our Brain technology at the RockShox RS-1 fork that differentiates between rider and trail input to stay firm under effort and compliant over bumps, a venerable SRAM XX1 groupset with Shimano XTR brakes, and hand-built carbon wheels, and you have a bike that sacrifices nothing in the pursuit of speed.\r\n\r\nTo provide the optimal blend of stiffness, light weight, and strength, we constructed the frame from our FACT 11m carbon fiber.

Compared to a traditional fork, its inverted design creates a carbon fiber upper that provides superior stiffness, while behaving with more sensitivity to small bumps and more control over larger hits. And with Brain technology, these characteristics are amplified and even more efficient. It also includes our Spike Valve technology that minimizes yaw in cornering, while providing maximum travel in high velocity impacts.\r\nRoval Control SL 29 carbon fiber wheels are lightweight for climbs, hand-built for precision and durability, stiff for explosive sprints and nimble handling, and most importantly, exceptionally fast for hard, sustained efforts come race day.\r\nCasing the wheels are 29x2.0\" S-Works Fast Trak tires at the front and rear. Together, the tires provide a heightened level of fast-rolling traction and reliable protection that's well suited to the rigors of cross country racing.\r\nThe one-by drivetrain is controlled by SRAM's venerable XX1 components, while shifting duties are handled by a Shimano XTR carbon lever. Combined, the system forms the ultimate in efficiency and intuitive feel, while also having the added benefit of significant weight savings and minimal required maintenance."[0m,

The down tube, seat stays and even the bottom bracket hiding the cables and wires, protecting them from external influences. The Disconnect Brake Mount brake mounting is an innovative technical solution with out-towering design that has already proven itself with the GHOST RIOT and has been optimized again. The rear brake is directly connected to the X12 axle system with the LECTOR ULC models and protects the frame against thermal and mechanical loads while using less total weight. The geometry has also been refined. Shorter head tubes and chainstays provide more agility and more direct handling. In World Cup proved: 31.6 mm seat tube diameters allow the use of telescopic seatpost and thus more aggressive positions and maneuvers. The LECTOR is back - and it's faster than ever."[0m,

Angular forms and smooth transitions not only provide an unmistakable appearance, but also for more rigidity and better load distribution. All cables are inserted into the frame at the head tube or demand reappeared. The down tube, seat stays and even the bottom bracket hiding the cables and wires, protecting them from external influences. The Disconnect Brake Mount brake mounting is an innovative technical solution with out-towering design that has already proven itself with the GHOST RIOT and has been optimized again. The rear brake is directly connected to the X12 axle system with the LECTOR ULC models and protects the frame against thermal and mechanical loads while using less total weight. The geometry has also been refined. Shorter head tubes and chainstays provide more agility and more direct handling. In World Cup proved: 31.6 mm seat tube diameters allow the use of telescopic seatpost and thus more aggressive positions and maneuvers. The LECTOR is back - and it's faster than ever. "[0m,

One look at the terrain tells you why – it’s rough, steep and more worthy of being a World Cup DH course than an enduro stage. Under these circumstances, the Nomad’s aggressive 65-degree head angle delivers V10 handling at Syndicate speeds. 165mm of VPP™ travel is delivered via a V10-style upper link and neatly recessed lower link design that's been extended to the Bronson and 5010.\r\n\r\nThe Nomad is uncompromising in its purpose, and as such has been designed specifically around one-by drivetrains only.  One-by offers a wide range of  options for just about any kind of riding, and the design permits some seriously compact chainstays.  On the front end of the bike, the rangy cockpit and relatively steep seat tube angle make for a surprisingly efficient pedaling position for such a capable descender. Internal cable routing comes courtesy of thin carbon fiber tubes molded into the frame from entry to exit, ensuring completely integrated, hassle-free routing every time.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves off more than half a pound from the frame.  \r\n\r\nSRAM’s more cost-effective one-by group, DT Swiss hubs, Reverb Stealth post\r\nRockshox Pike RCT3 160 Fork\r\nSRAM X01 Derailleur\r\nSRAM Guide RSC Brakes\r\nRaceface Turbine, 32t Cranks"[0m,

As for the build, you truly start to see the theme of uncompromising speed at work, as we've hung some of SRAM's most reliable parts on this bike. And to make sure that you'll be utilizing every watt of power out of them, we included our Mini Brain rear shock that differentiates rider input from trail bumps to ensure that the bike stays stiff when you need it to.

Además incluye una pipa de dirección forjada de 1,5 pulgadas para mejorar la mayoría de estas cualidades. En cuanto a su comportamiento, la Demo 8 combina nuestra Geometría S3 con un diseño asimétrico del cuadro que garantiza un fácil acceso al amortiguador, gran espacio libre en el tubo superior para un mayor control, vainas ultra- cortas que proporcionan agilidad, un pedalier bajo que mantiene la sensación de aplomo y estabilidad y un ángulo de dirección holgado para ofrecer la máxima manejabilidad y sensibilidad a alta velocidad. Para la suspensión, esta Demo cuenta con 200 mm de recorrido delante gracias a una horquilla RockShox BOXXER RC 650b y 200 mm detrás controlados por FOX VAN RC con ajuste personalizado. En conjunto, esta combinación asegura que seas capaz de surcar cualquier terreno con total confianza.

Que te encuentras con nuestra Demo 8 II, por supuesto. Su cuadro está fabricado en aluminio M5, y como hemos dicho, cuenta con una geometría sin igual. Encontrarás un acceso muy fácil al amortiguador, mucho espacio sobre el tubo superior para un mayor control, ágiles vainas ultra-cortas, una caja de pedalier baja que mantiene la sensación de aplomo, y un tren delantero con ángulo holgado que proporciona la máx- ima manejabilidad y sensibilidad a alta velocidad. 200 mm de recorrido en las susspensiones tanto delante como detrás, gracias a una horquilla RockShox BOXXER Team 650b y un amortiguador Öhlins. En cuanto al montaje, esta Demo viene con ruedas Roval 650b fabricadas a mano para mayor manejabilidad, transmisión monoplato SRAM, frenos SRAM Guide RS DH con todos los ajustes, ultra precisos y potentes. Esta bici se niega a ceder terreno cuando se trata de bajar a la máxima velocidad, justo como tú sabes hacerlo."[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"When the time came to examine whether to give the V10 27.5-inch wheels, we turned to the Syndicate, who rode the prototypes, gave us feedback, and ultimately raced the bike on the World Cup circuit. By the time the season was over, the new bike had garnered the 2014 World Cup title, and a World Champs medal. Those accolades speak for themselves, but we were eager to improve.\r\n\r\nDrawing on feedback from Peat, Minnaar and Bryceland on their personal settings, the 6th generation of our flagship model now offers 216mm / 8.5” of travel in two adjustable geometry positions:\r\nHigh: 64° headtube angle / 360mm bottom bracket height.\r\nLow: 63.5° headtube angle / 353mm bottom bracket height.\r\n\r\nThe shock rate has been tuned to be more linear and deliver  consistent damping throughout the travel. Carbon lay-up analysis and frame shape optimization allowed for more efficient use of material, and the savings were then reinvested into other areas to ensure the bike withstands Ratboy’s huge flat landings.  The front triangle and swingarm sport larger-diameter sections, but we’ll refrain from the usual drone about the positive effect that has on strength and stiffness. The new frame benefits from a slightly longer reach to suit evolving rider preferences.  However, our athletes felt we always struck a good balance with our chainstay length, so we focused on maintaining this dimension when accommodating larger wheels.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves nearly a pound from the frame.  \r\n\r\n7-Speed DH kit, Fox fork and shock\r\nFox 40 Float RC2 27.5 Factory Flat Crown Fork\r\nSRAM X01 DH 7-Speed Derailleur\r\nSRAM Guide RSC Brakes\r\nRaceface SIXC Cranks"[0m,

In desert-dry conditions the wider tires float above the dust and find oases of grip where standard tires flounder. And when the monsoon comes, lower tire pressures pull the Tallboy through the slickest of root sections like a Defender on diff-lock.\r\n\r\nIn its 29-inch form, the Tallboy’s renowned rowdy streak comes to the fore. Happy at full gas, up or down hill, the speed and agility of the 29 configuration will have you bagging on e-bikes at every turn.\r\n\r\nA 68 degree head angle and 110mm of VPP travel distills the original Tallboy’s playful character into something all the more mischievous. Longer reach and shorter chainstays fuel that personality, and bring the Tallboy bang up to date with the rest of the Santa Cruz range.\r\n\r\nA flip chip on the upper link, combined with either a 130mm fork (for 27+) or 120mm fork (for 29-inch), ensures geometry remains consistent across a vast range of build kits and sizes, from S to XXL.\r\n\r\nThe versatile trail bike of choice for rapid riders like Greg Minnaar—the Tallboy is for those who don’t roll with the pack. \r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frames, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber.

Equally at home in the Trans-Provence as it was on The Ridge, updating and improving it was going to be no small feat.\r\n\r\nThe most visible upgrade is the completely new VPP® link arrangement.  The lower link tucks neatly above the bottom bracket, fully-recessed and protected from impacts.  Meanwhile the box-section upper link now mounts cleanly to the top-tube and enhances lateral stiffness as a result. Shock rate’s been refined in the process too, delivering greater small bump sensitivity and a more progressive mid-stroke.\r\n\r\nGeometry has also evolved subtly to meet demand from riders for a bike of this ilk.  The seat tube angle’s been steepened, placing the rider right above the cranks and perfectly in position to lay down the power. Meanwhile a one-degree slacker 66 degree head tube angle combines with a 20-25mm longer top tube and shorter chainstay length to create an evermore rally-ready geometry than its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber.

We also used 27.5\" wheels in the small and medium sizes to improve handling and create industry-leading standover height for shorter riders.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the large and extra-large sizes come with 29\" wheels so that taller riders benefit from the rolling advantages of that wheel size.

By the time the season was over, the new bike had garnered the 2014 World Cup title, and a World Champs medal. Those accolades speak for themselves, but we were eager to improve.\r\n\r\nDrawing on feedback from Peat, Minnaar and Bryceland on their personal settings, the 6th generation of our flagship model now offers 216mm / 8.5” of travel in two adjustable geometry positions:\r\nHigh: 64° headtube angle / 360mm bottom bracket height.\r\nLow: 63.5° headtube angle / 353mm bottom bracket height.\r\n\r\nThe shock rate has been tuned to be more linear and deliver  consistent damping throughout the travel. Carbon lay-up analysis and frame shape optimization allowed for more efficient use of material, and the savings were then reinvested into other areas to ensure the bike withstands Ratboy’s huge flat landings.  The front triangle and swingarm sport larger-diameter sections, but we’ll refrain from the usual drone about the positive effect that has on strength and stiffness. The new frame benefits from a slightly longer reach to suit evolving rider preferences.  However, our athletes felt we always struck a good balance with our chainstay length, so we focused on maintaining this dimension when accommodating larger wheels.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves nearly a pound from the frame.  "[0m,

One look at the terrain tells you why – it’s rough, steep and more worthy of being a World Cup DH course than an enduro stage. Under these circumstances, the Nomad’s aggressive 65-degree head angle delivers V10 handling at Syndicate speeds. 165mm of VPP™ travel is delivered via a V10-style upper link and neatly recessed lower link design that's been extended to the Bronson and 5010.\r\n\r\nThe Nomad is uncompromising in its purpose, and as such has been designed specifically around one-by drivetrains only.  One-by offers a wide range of  options for just about any kind of riding, and the design permits some seriously compact chainstays.  On the front end of the bike, the rangy cockpit and relatively steep seat tube angle make for a surprisingly efficient pedaling position for such a capable descender. Internal cable routing comes courtesy of thin carbon fiber tubes molded into the frame from entry to exit, ensuring completely integrated, hassle-free routing every time.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber.

Equally at home in the Trans-Provence as it was on The Ridge, updating and improving it was going to be no small feat.\r\n\r\nThe most visible upgrade is the completely new VPP® link arrangement.  The lower link tucks neatly above the bottom bracket, fully-recessed and protected from impacts.  Meanwhile the box-section upper link now mounts cleanly to the top-tube and enhances lateral stiffness as a result. Shock rate’s been refined in the process too, delivering greater small bump sensitivity and a more progressive mid-stroke.\r\n\r\nGeometry has also evolved subtly to meet demand from riders for a bike of this ilk.  The seat tube angle’s been steepened, placing the rider right above the cranks and perfectly in position to lay down the power. Meanwhile a one-degree slacker 66 degree head tube angle combines with a 20-25mm longer top tube and shorter chainstay length to create an evermore rally-ready geometry than its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber.

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"Hightower has the versatility to deal with whatever appears on the horizon.  Running either proven 29\" wheels or the new monster-truck 27.5”+ standard, Hightower seamlessly adapts to the trails and style you ride, no matter where you are in the world.  \r\n\r\nSo the big question, 27.5+ or 29?\r\n\r\n29\r\nIf straight line speed, rallying through rock gardens and sprinting out of turns is your bag, then 29” wheels are the big ticket. Upgrade to carbon rims and you have a precision instrument on your hands. \r\n\r\n27.5+\r\n​When conditions get loose and the traction just ain’t there, you’ll want to reach for bigger tires. 27.5+ elevates Hightower to a whole different level, enabling you to rise above the pow, rail the soft spots and carry momentum where standard tires bog down.\r\n\r\nNo matter what size you run, geometry remains optimized thanks to a neat little “High/Low” setting on the upper link that flips to adjust bottom bracket height*.  Hightower’s 67° head angle, longer reach and trim chain stays combine to create an altogether different class of dreadnought in any configuration.  Meanwhile, 150mm of seat dropper, a water bottle mount, and internal routing reflect an armada of killer details.\r\n\r\n135mm of VPP® travel is reinforced by a 148 rear axle spacing and the kind of Nomad-style linkage arrangement and swingarm design we reserve for the heaviest hitters in our model line up.  The resulting package leaves Hightower standing head and shoulders above anything else out there. \r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 230 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves off half a pound from the frame.  \r\n\r\n*Please note: 140mm fork comes standard on the 29” kits, and is exchanged for a 150mm version on the 27+ builds to keep the 67° head angle consistent."[0m,

This creates a uniquely playful character and an insatiable appetite for negotiating steep, rocky climbs.\r\n\r\nAnd when it’s time to head home, playtime becomes a riot. The new 5010 has a 67-degree head tube angle, more aggressive than before, and the longer top tube welcomes the use of shorter stems for more precise handling and greater confidence on rapid descents. The 5010 also shares all the latest VPP® hardware with the new Bronson. The top-tube-mounted, box-section upper link is a leap forward in durability and stiffness, and the lower link rests cleanly out of the way, dramatically improving clearance and minimizing rock strikes.\r\n\r\nBike choice can be a numbers game, but if your game is conquering epic trails then 5010 is the only number you need know. \r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber.

It takes all the best from the RIOT and builds it bigger, better and burlier for hard charging riders and racers who demand nothing but the best. It took two years to develop and test this aggressive new design, and with its pure-bred styling and 150 mm of RIOT-link suspension in the rear and 170 mm up front, it’s capable of plundering and plowing a path through even the roughest terrain. The PathRIOT’s suspension will be powered by Cane Creek’s new climb switch enabled Double Barrel coil shock for the ultimate in trail taming technology, and the optional front derailleur mount and ISCG 05 tabs give you the freedom to run a wide range of drivetrain setups.

For the first time in GHOST history, the SL AMR represents a bike built as part of a platform. It shares frame technologies with its siblings, which is the key to delivering great quality for an outstanding price. With its aggressive, edgy shapes, it offers the original RIOT-styling at an affordable price. It features the most up to date industry technologies, benchmark components and a super-light anodized rear triangle with an unique chain stay yoke. Its torsion cross provides an unprecedented internal cable routing solution and stiffness like never before. Most of the braking forces are absorbed by our second generation disconnect brake mount which attaches directly to the X12 rear axle. You will love unleashing the full potential of this machine while pushing your own limits as well. It’s time to slam the trails! "[0m,

Efficiency is taken another step further with our proprietary Brain technology at the fork and rear shock. This intelligent system is able to interpret the difference between rider and trail input, so it stays firm under effort and compliant over bumps. Then there's our XC 29 Geometry that's built for sheer speed over long courses which, after four ABSA Cape Epic wins and multiple World Championships, has truly earned its salt. And to round out the package is a component spec that's nothing short of future-proof, with Shimano XTR Di2 and the incomparable RockShox RS-1 fork.

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"By integrating the requests of our team riders with the demands of our engineers, we’ve created our most spectacular hardtail ever. The integration of angular shapes and smooth transitions provides additional torsional stiffness, improved stress distribution and a distinctive look. All cables enter the frame at the head tube and reemerge appropriately, while the port under the bottom bracket serves both to protect the frame and to provide easy access for maintenance. The chain stay is protected from damage by a specially formed plastic sheath. The disconnect brake mount, an innovative technical feature already proven on the GHOST RIOT, has been redesigned for use on the Lector . In addition to a point on the seat stay, it is mounted directly to the X12 thru-axle and thus maintains perfect alignment with respect to the brake rotor, with the added benefit of helping to transfer braking forces into the axle instead of the carbon of the frame. The geometry has been refined with one goal in mind, better agility and more precise handling. The 31.6 mm seat tube diameter also gives you the option of using a dropper seat post, as some on the World Cup now do, letting you ride even more aggressively in technical terrain. LECTOR is back and killing it. "[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"It is nothing less than the homecoming of a legend. With the new NINETY-SIX, MERIDA proudly presents the second generation of one of the most successful XC full suspensions of all time.\r\n\r\nOriginally launched for the 2007 season, already the prototype of the first NINETY-SIX showed of what it would be capable. Shortly before serial production, one of the last test versions was pedaled by the MULATIVAN MERIDA BIKING TEAM to a spectacular second place at the Cross Country World Championships – simply the perfect accolade. Later it received numerous recommendations and awards worldwide, among them the prestigious “Milestone Award” from renowned German magazine “BIKE” – before passing the torch to its successor NINETY-NINE in 2011.\r\n\r\nThe backdrop to the switch to a new model at that time was that double-chainring drivetrains started to dominate especially the XC World Cup racing circuit. With the NINETY-SIX kinematically being a child of the triple-chainring era, its successor was developed around the new system. One year later, MERIDA responded to the increasing use of big wheels on the international racing tracks and presented a state-of-the-art 29er.\r\n\r\nBut the world of mountain biking kept on changing, and just like our MULTIVAN MERIDA BIKING TEAM, we also like to keep moving. Another chainring has vanished from XC racing by now, and 1x11 drivetrains are radically changing how we build mountain bikes in general. With the brand-new NINETY-SIX, the future is already here. Geometrically and kinematically optimized for single chainring set ups, this bike is ready to face the challenges of elite XC racing head on.\r\n\r\nIts stellar weight and superb pedaling efficiency are accompanied by the relocation of the rear shock to below the top tube, which makes for a very direct linkage. This position also allows for the remote lockout to be used perfectly. With new technologies like the “Smart Entry” clamped internal routing of all cables (also Di2) and “Race Link” suspension, the name NINETY-SIX again stands for one of the most exiting bikes in the XC World Cup. Thanks to 29er and 27.5” wheel size options for different frame sizes, it also stands for incredible versatility"[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"The prologue to the Nomad Carbon CC XX1 Complete Mountain Bike's story is the 65-degree head tube, which sits just one degree steeper than the dual-crown V10 and makes for a long, stable wheelbase that comes within two inches of Santa Cruz's dedicated DH sled. That makes the Nomad's story seem pretty straightforward at first, but the subsequent chapters flesh-out and complicate it. These complications include putting the emphasis on power transfer with a steep seat tube angle and chainstays virtually on par with the Bronson and almost rivaling the nimble 5010 for stubbiness. Add to this 6.5in of travel, and the Nomad begins to resemble the bridge between DH, enduro, and trail bikes, a truly novel approach to an all-mountain rig.\r\n\r\nIf the Nomad's geometry recommends it for all-mountain chaos, then the light, stiff Carbon CC frame construction means that chaos isn't limited to just DH. It may not be a featherweight climber, but with a claimed frame weight of around 2,800g, it's not that far off the mark. The frame returns in 2016 with the same material and build as 2015's top Nomad model, which means that it remains Santa Cruz's best. For the CC build, the engineers use a higher modulus carbon than the Carbon C model, so less material is required to hit the same strength and stiffness numbers. Less material equates to less weight, and, well, you can see where we're going with this. Climbing and pure speed both benefit when there's less mass for your engine to propel.\r\n\r\nThe frame's two carbon triangles are built as whole pieces rather than glued together from disparate bits. This saves weight and increases structural integrity by allowing Santa Cruz to wrap carbon continuously through and around key junctures. This method reinforces the frame with less material while eliminating the artificial stress points that result from bonded construction methods. Finally, the carbon is also compacted from the inside and the outside for a more even finish that avoids any structural defects, excess material build-up, and resin pooling for — you guessed it — even more weight savings.\r\n\r\nAll that carbon goodness meets at a VPP suspension platform, which returns for the new model year with the same improved mid-stroke support and small bump compliance that maintains snappy pedaling to take advantage of the stiff, lightweight chassis and relatively stubby chainstays while piloting the Nomad's 6.5in of travel to the top of your favorite runs. The system's two counter-rotating links yield a vertical wheel path in initial travel to maintain a firm pedaling feel over small bumps and climbs. As the bike compresses deeper into the suspension, the axle moves rearward to accommodate big hits for extra margin of error when you’re experimenting with the Nomad's long, low geometry on the ragged edge of control.\r\n\r\nDespite the frame's enduro posture, the Nomad's XX1 build kit looks more like something we'd expect to find on a professional XC rig. SRAM's one-by trump card, XX1, gets the nod for the entire drivetrain save the Race Face SIXC Carbon crankset. The combination of weight savings, durable simplicity, and a generous 10-42t cassette range all complement the Nomad's versatile, all-mountain tendencies. The wheels feature Easton's new ARC 27 rims laced to DT Swiss's 240s hubs, whose fast engagement plays a key role in popping the Nomad over a rocky crux move before dropping in and laying waste."[0m,

This creates a uniquely playful character and an insatiable appetite for negotiating steep, rocky climbs.\r\n\r\nAnd when it’s time to head home, playtime becomes a riot. The new 5010 has a 67-degree head tube angle, more aggressive than before, and the longer top tube welcomes the use of shorter stems for more precise handling and greater confidence on rapid descents. The 5010 also shares all the latest VPP® hardware with the new Bronson. The top-tube-mounted, box-section upper link is a leap forward in durability and stiffness, and the lower link rests cleanly out of the way, dramatically improving clearance and minimizing rock strikes.\r\n\r\nBike choice can be a numbers game, but if your game is conquering epic trails then 5010 is the only number you need know. \r\n\r\nThis CC-level carbon frame is every bit as stiff and strong as our C-level frame, but weighs about 280 grams less, due to the use of some lighter, stronger, and more expensive carbon fiber. Using this material in key places allowed us to use less material overall, which is what shaves off more than half a pound from the frame. \r\n\r\nFox 34 Float Factory Kashima 130 Fork\r\nSRAM XX1 Eagle Derailleur\r\nSRAM Guide Ultimate Brakes\r\nSRAM XX1 Eagle; 32t Cranks"[0m,

Up front, a RockShox Reba RL suspension fork with 100mm of travel helps keep everything super stiff while absorbing enough of the rough stuff to let you be less choosy with your line.\r\nA full Shimano Deore XT M8000 11-speed drivetrain delivers some of the smoothest and most reliable shifting in the business. This 2x11 drivetrain benefits from plenty of trickle down tech from Shimano's fabled XTR group, for crisp dependable shifting. Shimano M506 hydraulic brakes provide the best stopping power you'll find anywhere. Rounding out the build is set of KTM Line CC 27.5\" rims, laced to Shimano Deore hubs. All wrapped with Schwalbe Rocket Ron Evo 27x2.25\" tires. Topping the bike is a Selle Italia X1 Flow saddle, with a KTM 27.2mm alloy seat post. "[0m,

Blending the best elements of a hardtail mountain bike and a Euro-style commuter, this is a bike for someone who loves to ride anywhere, in any weather conditions. You could say it's the ultimate adventure bike. With a high performance alloy frame that's stiff, lightweight and durable and a Suntour SF15 XCT suspension fork with 100mm of suspension travel to take the sting out of light trail riding or rough roads. Shifting duties are handled by a Shimano Acera 3x8 drivetrain that gives you 24 speeds to choose from, while stopping is accomplished via Shimano M355 hydraulic disc brakes, which offer powerful stopping performance in nearly any weather.\r\nThe KTM Chicago 27.24 Disc H features a set of 27.5\" wheels mounted with huge Ruben V85 Ocelot tires coming in at 2.1\" inches wide. So go ahead and plan your next adventure--even if it's just to the office. You never know where the Chicago might take you. "[0m,

     :description_en[0;37m => [0m[0;33m"The KTM Fat Rat is a fat bike that blends the legendary versatility these bikes are known for, with the performance advantages of a high-end mountain bike. If you've ever ridden a fat bike, you already know how they combine the best aspects of a hard tail and a full-suspension bike into one machine. If you've never ridden one, then rest assured that once you do, you'll wonder if it might be the only off-road bike you need. \r\nThe full alloy frame is stiff and lightweight with a rigid tail for faster accelerations and improved handling. The RockShox Bluto RL 26\" suspension fork with 150mm of travel and 15mm thru axle dropout helps take the sting out of a trail and improves front end rigidity. The real stars of the show though are the KTM FAT Line 26\" wheels wrapped up in massive Schwalbe Jumbo Jim 80mm wide tires. These big, fat aggressive tires add a suspension-like quality to the ride without sacrificing pedaling efficiency, while giving you the ability to roll over pretty much anything in your path. \r\nShifting duties fall to SRAM X9 shifters and derailleurs for crisp, dependable shifting every time. The SRAM X9 double crank set helps keep the weight low, and the crank arms stiff for an easier to manage ride. Shimano Deore M615 hydraulic disc brakes help slow down your fat bike roll with some of the best disc braking performance in the business. Finally, KTM alloy components and a Selle Italia Q-Bik saddle round out the components package."[0m,

A Fox Float DPS Perf shock in the rear, and a Fox 36 Talas 160mm fork in the front handle suspension duties. The compact and rigid front triangle with its sloping geometry ensures a lower stand-over height. An improved bike handling was realized through a more flat head tube angle, steeper seat tube angle and longer top tube combined with shorter stem. To add the final touch to this harmonious concept, the ball bearings are bigger dimensions which results in better strength and durability."[0m,

The Lycan LT is built around a long travel alloy frame--which is durable, stiff and very lightweight. It's a bike that can tackle just about any terrain you throw it at, and survive to tell the tale, while still letting you have with the pack when it's time to pin on a race number.\r\nBut of course handling some gnarly terrain isn't easy without an excellent suspension system to back it up--which is why the Lycan LT is equipped with a RockShox PIKE RC, 27.5” suspension fork. This bad boy gives you 160mm of travel to let the bike take some huge hits, and a 15mm thru axle that helps stiffen up the front end and keep everything aligned. In the rear RockShox Monarch RT-D2\r\nLockout w/o Remote suspension helps keep you comfortable on any terrain. Fork remote gives you the ability to lock out the suspension to improve pedaling efficiency or make climbing easier.\r\nA full Shimano Shimano Deore XT M8000 drivetrain delivers some of the smoothest and most reliable shifting in the business. This 2x11 drivetrain benefits from plenty of trickle down tech from Shimano's fabled XT group, for crisp dependable shifting. Shimano Deore XT M8000 Ice-Tec brakes provide the best stopping power you'll find anywhere. A great drivetrain demands prime components, which is why the bike rolls on DT Team 27.5\" tubeless rims laced to DT Swiss hubs, all wrapped up in a Schwalbe Hans Dampf TrailStar front tire, and a Schwalbe Rock Razor PaceStar rear tire. Topping things off is a Fizi:k Nisene saddle, and Kindshoc LEV-DX hydraulic adjustable 100/125mm dropper post."[0m,

To maximize efficiency, the proprietary design allows the shock to differentiate rider input and trail bumps, so the suspension feels firm under effort and plush over rough terrain.\r\nA RockShox Reba RL 29 fork offers up 100mm of smooth travel, while an easily accessible compression and rebound adjusts permit you to customize the feel according to the terrain at hand.\r\nRoval 29 alloy wheels feature a 21mm internal width, making them plenty stiff and lightweight for XC racing.\r\nThe drivetrain is comprised of a mix of SRAM 1x11 components, hand-selected to provide maximum performance at a more palatable value.

Or in other words, you need the S-Works Stumpjumper FSR Carbon 29. It reflects everything that we've learned over the years, and in our eyes, represents the pinnacle of trail performance. Starting at the carbon layup, it features our highest-end FACT 11m for an ultra-lightweight, strong, and stiff construction. The carbon molding process also allowed us to revolutionize how you carry your trail essentials with the all-new SWAT Door found at the down tube. This compartment will fit a tube, a tool, and pump without rattling or compromising the structural integrity of the frame. And when you add-in an aggressive, trail-eating geometry that features ridiculously short chainstays, a roomy top tube, a low bottom bracket, and a slacked out front end, our proprietary Rx Trail Tune at the shock, and a build spec that spares no expense, you have a bike that, without a doubt, is ready for anything on the trail.\r\n\r\nFACT 11m carbon fiber Trail Chassis with Stumpjumper FSR full carbon rear end blends stiffness with light weight to form the pinnacle of efficiency, while fully enclosed cable routing and an integrated SWAT Door create exceptional handling and zero-hassle storage.\r\nConnected with our FSR 6-Pack Linkage, a custom FOX FLOAT Factory rear shock features AUTOSAG for easy setup and 135mm of plush, adjustable suspension, while our Rx Trail Tune provides a more supple, responsive, and efficient feel for climbing up and descending down the trail.\r\nRockShox Pike RCT3 29 fork features a 15mm Maxle Ultimate thru-axle and 140mm of plush travel to take on big hits and bumpy terrain with supreme confidence and efficiency.\r\n29x2.3” Specialized Butcher Control front tire inspires confidence through any terrain.\r\n29x2.3” Specialized Purgatory Control rear tire delivers reliable traction over a diverse section of soils and conditions.\r\nCommand Post IRcc seatpost features 12 positions of up to 125mm of height adjustability for a more customizable position, ultimately resulting in more control and increased handling on both climbs and descents."[0m,

It's made from our finest carbon fiber, and it's built off of our revolutionary XC 29 Geometry for explosive power, incredible climbing prowess, and nimble handling. At the rear, the hardtail design with razor thin seatstays blends maximum pedaling efficiency with added compliance. Add to this our Brain technology at the RockShox RS-1 fork that differentiates between rider and trail input to stay firm under effort and compliant over bumps, a venerable SRAM XX1 groupset with Shimano XTR brakes, and hand-built carbon wheels, and you have a bike that sacrifices nothing in the pursuit of speed.\r\n\r\nTo provide the optimal blend of stiffness, light weight, and strength, we constructed the frame from our FACT 11m carbon fiber. And when combined with our XC 29 Geometry, the Stumpjumper is guaranteed to deliver uncompromising, blistering speed come race day—no matter the course.\r\nRockShox RS-1 Brain fork is arguably the most sought-after fork in XC racing. Compared to a traditional fork, its inverted design creates a carbon fiber upper that provides superior stiffness, while behaving with more sensitivity to small bumps and more control over larger hits. And with Brain technology, these characteristics are amplified and even more efficient. It also includes our Spike Valve technology that minimizes yaw in cornering, while providing maximum travel in high velocity impacts.\r\nRoval Control SL 29 carbon fiber wheels are lightweight for climbs, hand-built for precision and durability, stiff for explosive sprints and nimble handling, and most importantly, exceptionally fast for hard, sustained efforts come race day.\r\nCasing the wheels are 29x2.0\" S-Works Fast Trak tires at the front and rear. Together, the tires provide a heightened level of fast-rolling traction and reliable protection that's well suited to the rigors of cross country racing.\r\nThe one-by drivetrain is controlled by SRAM's venerable XX1 components, while shifting duties are handled by a Shimano XTR carbon lever. Combined, the system forms the ultimate in efficiency and intuitive feel, while also having the added benefit of significant weight savings and minimal required maintenance."[0m,

With an exemplary FACT carbon construction and a build kit that's just itching to perform on race day, it's certainly considered pro-worthy.

Depending on what fork travel you choose, this bike’s personality ranges from well-mannered trail bike to lightweight enduro weapon. Sounds good? We think so. "[0m,
